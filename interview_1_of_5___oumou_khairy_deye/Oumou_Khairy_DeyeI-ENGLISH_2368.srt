00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,880
As far as the maternity hospital...

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,840
The impact on the maternity hospital...

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,440
As far as the maternity hospital
and the health clinic in Yamane

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,160
we have seen

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,000
better reception conditions

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,500
for patients,

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,680
better reception conditions,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,120
an improvement in reception conditions

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,640
We have a waiting room, a large waiting room,

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,480
a small room with chairs pushed together.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,720
We also have beds,

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,760
we have two beds per room.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,500
All rooms are equipped with beds.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,800
There's a corner for newborns

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
with a delivery table.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
Also in the delivery room,

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,160
we have a portable lamp

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,120
and a baby scale on site.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,760
Everything is financed by Waitrose

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
We are really satisfied

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600
with our partner, Waitrose

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,000
We are really satisfied

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
and we thank you very much

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,800

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,440
not only as a population, but also

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,500

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,640
