1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Please introduce yourself,
tell us your job

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,480
and explain
where are you right now.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
OK, I am practically
in a village

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,700
which is called Demizine,
a village which is

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,440
behind the SCL.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,560
And my name is

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,840
(Sheikh Abou Njie?)

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,640
I am the
deputy headmaster

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There you are

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Thank you

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,000
Can you tell us what

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
the Waitrose foundation
has achieved

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,480
and what the impact has been
for children,

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,880
both in terms of academic results
and hygiene?

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,480
OK, thanks.
Thanks, thanks.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,400
The Waitrose foundation

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,000
has done a lot of things
for the school.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Initially, there wasn't
very much here.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
The classrooms were

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
in very poor condition,

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,300
But the Waitrose foundation
together with the SCL

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,200
came to repair, to renovate,
the classrooms

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
and indeed

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,800
not just the classrooms...

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,640
the toilets have been
renovated too.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,000
Even the front of the
classrooms have been renovated.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,080
And today, really,
we are very proud of

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
this foundation along with the SCL.
We are very proud.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,320
And how have the children
been affected?

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,680
What has improved for
the children?

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
Well, you know, at the beginning,
it was a bit difficult

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,000
to have many students
in school

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
because the school was not
in very good shape.

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,300
But today,
now that the classrooms

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,000
have been well renovated,
we are really witnessing

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,800
an increase in attendance

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,000
because we're seeing
parents, inhabitants,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,700
bringing their children
to school.

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,300
And then, the results
are really good

40
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,700
in of the municipality
of Yamane.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,400
In of the municipality
of Yamane,

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,500
We have achieved a pass rate
of 100%

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,000
in succession, because
last year

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
in 2019 we had
almost 95%.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,500
The following year, in 2021,
we had almost 95%.

46
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
And this year, this past year,
2021, I mean 2022,

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,400
we achieved a pass rate of 100%
at the municipality level,

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
so, we are leading
in school.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,500
So this is due to

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,900
the work that
has been conducted

51
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,400
by the people of Waitrose
and the SCL.

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
So, we got 100%

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
This means that
all students

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,400
passed the exam.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
And what about the impact of
Waitrose's achievements

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,440
in terms of health and
children's hygiene?

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,200
Yes, I wanted to
get back to that

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
because,
in terms of health,

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
it's true that they
have developed

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,800
many things
concerning the toilets

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,600
indeed, previously,
there were no toilets.

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
So, this has
this really resulted in

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
much better hygiene

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
in the local area.

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,200
Really, we are very proud
of this.

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,640
So, as far as health
is concerned,

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,600
there's also the use
of certain (resources?)

68
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
provided by the SCL.

69
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,500
There are the toilets
which have been renovated

70
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,600
and which are still cleaned
from time to time by the students.

71
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,800
So, this encourages
good practice at home

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
because when a student
has practised something at school,

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
once they return to their house,


74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
they will implement it
at home too.

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,400
So, I think it's
a very good achievement.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
So, they did very well.

77
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
And what can you say

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,700
about the impact
that has been made

79
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,500
by fencing-off
the school?

80
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,200
Exactly.

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Why is it important
to fence off a school?

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Very well.

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,900
So, in effect, there are schools
that are not fenced-off.

84
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,760
So firstly, as far as
security is concerned...

85
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,920
That's it

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,200
You need to start off by saying that
the wall has allowed...

87
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,920
OK

88
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,960
To begin with, there was
no wall, no fence.

89
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
That meant that animals

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,700
practically roaming around at school,
even in the classroom

91
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,000
and in the playground.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,800
So, it was an area of pasture
for the animals.

93
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,000
But now that the fence
has been installed,

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
you can see that,
clearly,

95
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,600
the animals can no longer
access the school.

96
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,300
Then, the act of teaching
in school

97
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,800
while the school
is not closed-off,

98
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,700
is a risk
for the teacher.

99
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,600
You can be teaching
in your classroom,

100
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,000
while there are intruders,
people who can enter

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,800
your classroom
and give you some

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,200
I don't know...
That can happen.

103
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,640
But once the fence is there,
we close the doors.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Nobody comes in,
nobody leaves.

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
It is a danger that
has been averted.

106
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,120
So, as far as security is concerned,
we are really

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,100
very safe.

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,600
And what do you think
is the impact...

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
What does education represent

110
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,400
for the communities here?
Children's education?

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,500
Well, at the beginning,
you could say there was

112
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,480
a lack of understanding on the part of
the communities here.

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,200
But today, we clearly see that
children's education

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,400
- and especially girls' education -
is something that

115
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,300
has been fully embraced
by people.

116
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,700
So, we clearly see that despite
their actions in the SCL

117
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,300
parents bring students
to school here.

118
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,000
So, all parents
from all households,

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,500
bring students
to school here.

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,800
So, I really think
the level of school attendance

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,900
here is practically
at 100%.

122
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,080
OK, is that alright?

123
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Is that OK?

124
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
It's perfect,
it's perfect.
