1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,000
There are

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,920
lead, what!

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,920
For breakfast.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,600
At breakfast, I take fresh cow's milk.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,120
Sound.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,200
So we're going to ask you to introduce your name.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,560
What you do in the village who you are

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,040
and is where are we currently in which site we are?

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,760
My name is Ousman Sow

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
I live in the village of Ngallan

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
So at the level of this village, I manage.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,320
I do a bit of animation at the social level.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,800
By the way, I'm also a member of

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,160
this pub

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,080
called the farm.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,080
And there, we do breeding,

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,440
vocational training and many other things.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,480
The processing of fruit and vegetable products.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,760
And There you go.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,960
And therefore the project that will be supported

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,680
by the SPL and the Waitrose Foundation.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,440
What will it bring to the village level?

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,040
The Baker

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,920
from college,

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,080
which is to be installed here at the village level of the Apple station

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,200
which is also supported

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,480
by the and the Metro Foundation.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
It's a project that is close to my heart

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,160
the entire population of the area.

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,080
So to do this, we have a negative history.

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,760
Because

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,400
the village is seven kilometers away.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,040
It was necessary that each time the students, because the mother,

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,040
every morning, she had to come in the evening.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,840
That was really a real headache.

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
And that's how we could enjoy

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,320
of the installation of ADSL next door to effectively

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,080
try to find partners who can support us for really

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,640
an evening and a school that will solve all these words that I just said.

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,840
And in your opinion, what impact will it have on the education of children?

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,600
I believe that

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,680
the impact will be

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,680
very positive because I know there has been before.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
There have been many young people who have dropped out of school

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,320
because of that distance.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,280
I believe that once

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,920
this college is installed.

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:58,920
That's it.

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,040
Take.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,480
Same.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,720
A good

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,320
education.

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,840
To the studies carried out.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,640
Get out school because it was.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,520
To one.

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,880
Welcome from the road.

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,560
Et aussi the time Warner and

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
go to

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,720
great.
