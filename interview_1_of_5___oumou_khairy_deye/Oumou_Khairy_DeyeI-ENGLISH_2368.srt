1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,880
At the material level.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,400
In this case the mechanics.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,840
The impact on maternity,

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,440
at maternity and health post level.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,160
We noted a

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,480
better conditions have been noted

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,880
home relative relative

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,680
to patients, better reception conditions,

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,120
better improvement of reception conditions.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,640
We had a waiting room, a big waiting room,

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,480
a small room with chairs pushed together.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,720
We also have beds,

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,760
we have more rooms.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,120
All rooms are equipped with new

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,800
born, newborns with a delivery table.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
Also in the delivery room.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,160
We had a portable lamp,

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,120
we have a baby scale on site.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,760
Everything is financed by the wife.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
We are really satisfied

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600
compared to partners.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
We are really satisfied.

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,800
We thank you very much for the gesture you have made.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,080

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,440
to the population and us too.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,280

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,640

All of this is done at the maternity level.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,280
Did childbirths do

40

births too?

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,240
