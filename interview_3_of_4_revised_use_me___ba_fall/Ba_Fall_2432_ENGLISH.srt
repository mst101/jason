1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,720
Introduce yourself, say what you do and your point of view.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,280
It reminds me of my wife.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,640
I live in the village of 2000.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,960
I am the employee of the STL.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,760
I am the president

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,240
parents of home school students.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,400
Can you show us the achievements

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,160
of the Waitrose Foundation

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,840
and also what was the impact for the students and for the community?

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,960
Yes, a small piece of the realization

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,360
from our partnership partner

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,360
has effects on many things

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
who we.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,280
Can you say we will resume?

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,800
When you present, you say.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,040
Thanks to the support of the Foundation. Kraft.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,920
We were able to achieve

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,440
voilà.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,440
In ten years, the impact of the achievements

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,160
with the Waitrose Foundation have been validated.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,800
So what were the impacts of

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,960
their ?

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,080
Where to a pact

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,360
of partnership.

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,440
Where is your

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
who awaits us?

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
You have to say

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,960
the achievements that have been made with the Waitrose Foundation.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,920
Yes yes.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,920
What to do with the Wesley Endowment Fund

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,080
Watson.

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,760
Waitrose or

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
Waitrose ?

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,800
Waitrose, Waitrose.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,240
Likewise, the butt.

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
Has a taste.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,840
Waitrose, Waitrose, Waitrose,

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,840
Waitrose.

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,400
Okay will interest you.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Go there with the partnership of Watson.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
We have a lot of accomplishments

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,560
on the

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,640
school culture,

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,800
classes and

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,400
the appearance of tables

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,440
foundation and paintings and canvases.

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,480
And again, we do

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,760
toilet

49
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,120
for boys and toilets for girls

50
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,160
and where to

51
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
our student.

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,280
They always admitted that for that.

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Students

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,720
last year, we had all the students.

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,640
They have passed

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
sixth to sixth

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,560
from college.

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,840
And what were, according to you, that you can

59
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,920
specify a little bit the impacts for the students, precisely?

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,840
Begins to improve exam results, children's success.

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,600
And what is the impact also for the populations?

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,120
In a general way.

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,240
The impact of students?

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,400
If we say that, we have a lot.

65
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,560
Finally, there are the students,

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,080
especially students and teachers

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,040
who are there.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,080
They did everything to inform the students

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
from U.S.

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,920
the whole population of the village.

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,680
They are so happy with this achievement

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,920
from school

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
of Déneigé.

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,280
And U.S

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,480
encore

76
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,800
solicited in

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,080
the name of the STL

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
that supports us a lot with the partnership

79
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
PCR Partnership or

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,840
of course What's Going.

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,160
And you?

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,680
How many students are there in the school?

83
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,320
What is

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
with the rehabilitation of the school, there were more pupils who came?

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,840
And have exam results improved? Yes.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,000
Each year, we registered

87
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,040
the more than 150 students

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,720
entering the CE2 class.

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,080
If we have twelve or fifteen students

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,840
of CMDs that have switched to

91
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,200
sixth or sixth sixth college

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
And the others ?

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,000
We are every year, we have at the level of new students,

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,960
trees and tree shops.

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
Where did you register?

96
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,440
more than 20 or 25 people

97
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,720
in Montreal East.

98
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
A lot of

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,240
teachers,

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,640
because teachers are very important

101
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,920
in that world.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
And I don't know

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,680
if we could explain

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
in what

105
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,960
make them

106
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,560
were made with the Waitrose Foundation,

107
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,200
in particular to improve

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,440
access to toilets for children

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,800
impact on children's health and hygiene.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,200
Why is it important to have clean toilets?

111
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,200
Yeah.

112
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah.

113
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,240
Because saying with the support of the Foundation.

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
With support

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,520
of web partnerships, wishes

116
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,920
help a lot of student health and hygiene nets

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,200
because it makes the toilet, go make the donations

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
water, sanitation

119
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,080
safety, student hygiene,

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,960
nothing.

121
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,400
Why is it important for students?

122
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,160
Important work?

123
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,840
Because health is the first state of health

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,400
after doing hygiene.

125
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Because if there is no hygiene, no health, that is to say

126
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,680
if we get sick, it's because how do we get the toilets cleaned?

127
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,080
For security challenges,

128
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,120
health and hygiene, right?

129
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,280
And why ?

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,200
Is it important to separate the boys' toilets from the toilets?

131
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
Because why don't we know how to go?

132
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Because girls, everyone, girls and boys,

133
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,240
it is not even to a child not in the process of the same thing.

134
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,280
Because girls, if we did the toilet with legs

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,960
and the boys are on the way because we don't see the boys and the girls,

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,440
because it is that they were your

137
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
health.

138
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
You need hygiene.

139
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,240
And you think that

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,480
what are the achievements

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,520
which allow the most to have children in school?

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,960
That is to say that the children, from the moment there is water,

143
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,680
toilets, etc., they no longer want to go to school.

144
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,200
There you have it.

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,080
Because there is everything.

146
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,040
The students saying it

147
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,240
have finished,

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,720
everyone was coming to go back to class,

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:53,240
to teach them.

150
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,480
Can you explain

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,040
Why is the fence important for the toilet?

152
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,560
However, what is more secure?

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
The students do not draw from this Paris for the least saying

154
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
in the courtyard of the school of creation.

155
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,040
All.

156
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,080
If you see, there are premises, a field, there is a circle for them.

157
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,240
For international students, there are rubber bands

158
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,920
and a safety cord.

159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,480
The children who are there.

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
Maybe because it also avoids them.

161
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Vehicles, vehicles and animals again.

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,640
And for the little ones, little ones, little ones,

163
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,480
they don't have cows, try to depose us some

164
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,760
or even to avoid strangers who

165
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,160
they want without permission, are.
