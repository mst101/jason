1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:18,000
...

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,200
So can we ask you
to tell us your name,

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,560
what you do in the village,
who you are

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,040
and where are we currently,
on which site we are.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,760
My name is (Ousman Sowe?)

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
I live in the village of
(Ngara Peul?)

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
I help with the management
of the village

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
I do some social activism

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm also a member

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
of a private organisation

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,080
called (Ngarach?) Farm

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,080
And there,
we do animal husbandry,

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,440
vocational training
and many other things.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,480
The processing of
fruit and vegetable products.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,760
There you go.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,960
And so, the project
that will be supported

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,680
by the SCL
and the Waitrose Foundation,

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,440
how is it going to
benefit the village?

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,920
The school project,

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,080
which is being undertaken
in the village of (Ngara Peul?)

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,200
and which is supported

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,480
by the SCL
and the Waitrose Foundation,

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
is a project
that is close to the heart

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,160
of everyone in the district.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,080
There's a difficult backstory
to the project,

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,760
because previously,

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,100
the village being
7 km from (Raoule?),

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,000
students had to travel 7 km

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,600
to go to (Raoule?) each morning,
and the same to return in the evening.

30
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,840
That was a real struggle.

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
And so, that's why
we were able to benefit

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,320
from the establishment
of the SCL nearby

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,080
so that we could try to find partners
who could support us

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,640
to have a school that would
solve the difficulties I mentioned.

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,840
And in your opinion, how is that
going to impact children's education?

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,680
I think the impact will be

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,680
very positive because I know
that previously

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
many children quit school

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,320
because of the distance involved.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,280
I think that once the school

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,920
has been established,

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,000
these difficulties will be
just a distant memory.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
...
