1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Introduce yourself,
tell us what you do

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,800
and what your role is.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,280
My name is
Ba Faal.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,640
I live in the village
of Demizine.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,960
I am employed by
the SCL.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
I am

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,500
the president of
the Parent-Teacher Association

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
of the school
at Demizine.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,500
So, can you tell us
about the achievements

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
of the Waitrose Foundation

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
and also what
the impact has been

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
for students
and for the community?

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Yes

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,200
As for the achievements

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,000
of our partner

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,360
they've done
a lot of things.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,000
Can you get him to
include Waitrose in there?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,280
Can you say...
So, let's start again...

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,800
When you give your talk,
can you say

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,040
"Thanks to the help of
the Waitrose Foundation,

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,000
we have been able to..."

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
"The impact of the
Waitrose Foundation is..."

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,440
By saying,
"The impact of the achievements

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,160
made with the Waitrose Foundation
has been..."

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,800
OK, go on then.
What impacts have there been ?

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,000
The impact of our partner,
Waitrose,

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,000
Wait, let's start again...

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
You need to say...

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,960
"the achievements that have been made
with the Waitrose Foundation..."

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,920
Yes, yes.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:58,400
...

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Thanks to our partner,
Waitrose,

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,000
we have achieved a lot,

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
concerning

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
the school culture,

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
the classrooms,

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,500
repairing the tables,

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,440
the school grounds,
the paintings and canvases.

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,760
What's more,
they built toilets

49
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,000
for the boys
and toilets for the girls.

50
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,200
And as for the students

52
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,500
they always pass their exams
with a 100% success rate.

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,000
Last year,
all students,

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
progressed to the 6th grade
(i.e. Year 7 in the UK)

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,700
of the school.

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,600
And what do you think
have been...

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,920
Can you explain what the impacts
have been for the students?

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,840
How has this improved exam results,
the children's success?

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,600
And what has been the impact
for the local population

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
more generally?

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,240
The impact for students?

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,400
As far as that goes,
they've received

65
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,560
a lot of education,

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,080
thanks to the teachers
in particular

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,000
who are there.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,080
They've done everything
to teach the children,

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
our children.

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,500
Everyone in the village

71
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,680
is extremely happy about
this project

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,720
at Demizine school.

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,280
And we

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,480
again

76
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,800
congratulate

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,080
the engagement of the SCL

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
who support us a lot

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,680
along with our partner,
Waitrose.

80
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,840
Waitrose

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,160
And you?

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,400
How many children are
at the school?

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Have you experienced

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
an increase in attendance
since the rehabilitation of the school?

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,000
And have the exam results improved?

86
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Each year, we enrolled

87
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,040
more than 150 students.

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,720
From Year 6

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,080
we had twelve or fifteen
students

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,840
who progressed to

91
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,200
Year 7
at the school.

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
And as for the others,

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,800
each year,
we have new students,

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
from age 7,
they start at age seven.

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,500
We enrolled

96
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
more than
20 or 25 people.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
They've significantly improved

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,200
the teachers at the school

100
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,000
because teachers
are very important

101
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,920
in today's world.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
And...

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,680
if you could explain

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
what

105
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,960
achievements

106
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,000
have been made with
the Waitrose Foundation,

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
in particular

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,440
how access to toilets
for the children

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,800
has impacted the health
and hygiene of the children?

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
Why is it important
to have toilets at school

111
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,600
that are clean
and in good working order?

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah

113
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,240
You can say, "With the help
of the Waitrose Foundation..."

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
With the help of...

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,000
Our partner Waitrose
has helped a lot

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,200
with regard to the students'
health and hygiene

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,500
because they built the toilets,

118
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,000
and they provided water

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
for the safety
and hygiene of students.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
Why is this important for students?

122
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,160
Why is it important?

123
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,840
Because health comes first.
That's the most important thing.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,400
Then there's hygiene.

125
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,000
If there's no hygiene,
there's no health.

126
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,800
The students will get sick.

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,300
That's why we made the toilets.

127
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,080
For the girls,
for safety,

128
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,000
health,

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and hygiene.

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,120
That's it.

129
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,000
And why is it important

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
to separate the girls'
and boys' toilets?

131
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,400
Because...
Why did we separate them?

132
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Because in this world,
girls and boys,

133
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
should not

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
use the same toilets.

134
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,800
Because if the girls' toilets

135
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
and the boys' toilets
are separated

135
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,300
they shouldn't be mixed,
boys and girls.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,300
It's due to safety

137
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,640
health,

138
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
and hygiene.

139
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,240
And do you think that...

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,480
Which achievements have been made

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,520
that most encourage children
to come to school?

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,960
Well, as soon as children have water,

143
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,680
and toilets, etc.
they're more keen to come to school.

144
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,200
Well, that's it.

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,080
Because, if everything's there,

146
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,040
students, I mean,

147
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,240
they'll come.

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,720
They'll all come to school

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,000
to be taught.

150
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,480
Can you explain

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,040
why the fence
is important for the school?

152
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
The fence is important for the school
for the students' safety,

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
so they don't disappear.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,080
I mean, when everyone is

154
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
in the playground
at breaktime.

155
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
When they're all at breaktime,

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
can you see in the playground
there's an area

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
with a circle

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,500
for the students.

157
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,000
At breaktime,
they do gymnastics there.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And again, it's for their safety

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,480
that the children are there.

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
Could it be that
it also prevents

161
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,840
cars and animals?

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,640
And for the little kids,

163
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,480
there won't be any cows,
that come in here to disturb people.

164
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,760
What's more,
it prevents strangers

165
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,160
from coming in
without authorisation.
