1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,320
OK, so look what your name is

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,240
and what is your function and where are we now?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,640
My name is Syedou Kaa

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,720
I am in charge of external affairs of the SL

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,680
and we are in the village of Ngaallan

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,480
Paul.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,680
Can you tell us

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,840
how the site of the future college

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,040
has been identified as part of

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,240
of the project that is carried out with the Waitrose Foundation?

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,920
Try repeating the name of the Waitrose Foundation in the sentence.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,320
Anyway, the idea comes anyway

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,480
to the installation of the zone, there therefore to benefit from the land

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
at the level of the surrounding villages and that the village of

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,760
My essaya.

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,680
And starting from this installation,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,280
the populations nevertheless expressed the wish to have in the bank

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,440
because where they are now,

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,240
it is not a college, it is a training center which has been lent

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
by the village.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,600
So after grabbing the SL, the hall too had its partner.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,160
The Waitrose also decided to join forces with the authorities anyway.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,120
And to try to build a still worthy college that really deserves

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,160
so that the students can put themselves

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,840
in good conditions for studying.

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,240
And the college will respond to what type of need in the premises?

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,280
Which must be financed by the employees all the same.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,600
We observe

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,960
that a very sufficient social demand all the same,

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,840
also taking into account

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,120
villages a bit too far away

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,080
compared to the college which is in the area

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,640
and reason why the populations wish to have proximity

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,160
so that they can remain all the surrounding villages of this zone there.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,120
And why have a college?

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,080
It is important for the local people here

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,720
in relation to the education of their children?

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,840
Yes, it's still a necessity, because we realized

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,880
that even in the zone, the students have made a lot of effort.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,080
According to the statistics of this area there

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,160
and the college that is there

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,520
for the last three years anyway, they have the best ratings.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,600
An exam will be 100% successful and just that,

44
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,440
it motivates everyone all the same to put them in much more conditions

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,160
so that they can work and for like everyone else, be school.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
This is the common objective of the State.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,240
That's what people want.

48
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Had we done our best to push the children?

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,280
This is the reason why Toulouse and Essen were asked to succeed

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
this project together which is really a wish for the populations.

51
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,880
And it also meets a need of city workers

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,200
who live in the area here. Precisely because

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,840
that it is also in his interest to have his primary next door.

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,720
If he still has college nearby, that means his family will be nearby.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
Certain needs expressed by all the workers,

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,000
including the scale of populations, it is a problem for everyone.

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
It's a wish, it's a wish really that

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,760
people can

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,840
bring the children safely.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,040
Merci.

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,960
Very well thank you.
