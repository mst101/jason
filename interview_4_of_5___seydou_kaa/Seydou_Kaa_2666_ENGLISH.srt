1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,320
OK, so tell me your name

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,240
and what your role is
and where are we now?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,640
My name is (Syedou Kaa?)

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,720
I am in charge of
external affairs at SCL

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,000
and we are in the village of

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,480
(Gigila Peul?).

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,680
Can you tell us

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,840
how the site of the school

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,040
was identified as part of

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,240
of the project that is carried out
with the Waitrose Foundation?

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,920
Try to mention the name of the
Waitrose Foundation in your response.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,000
The idea came about

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
following the establishment of the SCL
in the local area

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
which was offered the land
by the surrounding villages,

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
namely the villages of

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,760
(Gigila Peul, Nyalaja Peul,
Mboye Esseya?).

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,680
And following this establishment,

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,600
people expressed their wish


19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,000
for a good school
that's worthy of the area

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,400
because where they are currently,

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,800
is not a school,
it was a training centre

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
which was offered up by
the village of (Gigila?).

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,600
So, once the land had been obtained,
the SCL also had its partner, Waitrose,

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,160
and they decided
to join up with the authorities

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,000
to try to build
a good school

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,160
where students
can be in conditions

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,840
that are conducive for studying.

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,500
What kind of needs
will the school cater for in the area?

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,280
Well, the school which still needs to be
supported by the SCL and Waitrose,

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,000
is our school
whose time has come

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,960
and for which there is
an important social demand,

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,840
when you consider

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,120
that these villages are
quite a long away

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,000
from the school
in (Rauou?)

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and it's for this reason
that people expressed their wish

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
to have a school close by

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,160
which can attract students from all the
surrounding villages in the area.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,120
And why have a school?

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,080
Is it important for
the local people here,

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,720
for their children's education?


38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,840
Yes, in fact it's necessity,
because we realised

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,880
that the children in the area,
have really been trying hard.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,080
According to the local authority's statistics

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,000
this school has achieved

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
the best exam results
in the last 3 years

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,600
a 100% success rate!

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,000
That alone is enough,

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,440
to motivate everyone
to improve conditions for the students

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,160
and to make sure everyone
goes to school.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
Because, that's the
state's objective, after all.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,00
It's what the people want.

48
00:02:33,00 --> 00:02:35,280
To maximise children's education.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,280
That's why Waitrose and the SCL
were called upon

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,500
to realise this project as it
responds to the people's strong desire.

51
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,880
And does it also cater for
the needs of SCL employees

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,000
who live in the
local area here?

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Absolutely, because an employee
who has a family,

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
well, it's in his/her interests
to have the family nearby.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If there's a school nearby,
it means his/her family

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
will be nearby too.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
This is a need expressed
by all workers,

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,000
including that of the wider population;
it's everyone's wish.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
It's a wish,
it's a real wish

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
to build a school
which will be worthy

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,840
and to which people can
take their children in complete safety.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,040
Thank you.

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,960
Very well, thanks.
