1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,360
Introduce yourself, go tell your function

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,480
where are you right now.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
Here, I am and I am practically in a village

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,040
which is called from my factories, a village which is

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,440
behind the room.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,560
and my name is

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,840
Exchange.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,640
I am assistant to the director

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,440
to the.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,520
Can you tell us what were

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,480
the achievements of the Waitrose Foundation and what are the impacts

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,880
for children, both in terms of results and hygiene?

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,480
There it is, thanks. Thanks thanks.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,800
The Fondation avec moi Metro has done a lot of things at the school level.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,280
Initially, there was not much with the classrooms that were

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,320
in very poor condition.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,160
But the Metro Foundation came with the SL

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,800
rectified to renovate

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,440
classrooms and so far not just classrooms.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,640
There are still toilets that are renovated.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,280
Even the fronts of the classrooms are renovated.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,080
And today, really, we are proud of

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
this foundation with which we are very proud.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,320
And what are the impacts for children?

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,680
What does it improve for children?

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
Well, you know, at the beginning, it was a bit difficult to have

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,320
many students in school because the school was not

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,360
In very good shape. But today,

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,480
with the classrooms which are very well renovated,

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,600
we are really witnessing

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,560
a capital importance of the school because we see as

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,280
the parents of pupils or the inhabitants bring the children to school.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,280
And then the results

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,480
really are very well at the level of the municipality of tomorrow.

35
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,800
At the level of the commune, kids.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,840
We had 100% successively last year.

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,760
In 99, we had almost 95%

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
the next year.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,240
In 2020, we had almost 95%.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
And this year, if last year 2020

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,840
we had 100% at the level of the commune, we are the first in school.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
So this is due to the works that are

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,560
slaughtered by the people of the Rose and the SL.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,720
We got 100%.

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,280
All the students

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,400
passed the exam.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
And on the impact of the Foundation's achievements

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,440
Waitrose Health and Hygiene.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,680
Children.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,600
Because, in terms of health, they have arranged many more

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,520
for the toilets whereas previously there were toilets,

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,000
so this really resulted in giving very good hygiene

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,640
to the locality.

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Really, we are very proud of it in the health field.

55
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,040
There is still the use of the resources given by the SL.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,640
There are still toilets that are renovated

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,520
and which are still cleaned from time to time by the pupils.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,480
So also practical at home because when the student

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,840
practiced something at school, once home, once

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,960
at his house.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
So I think it's a very good achievement.

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
So they did very well.

63
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,560
And what do you mean in terms

64
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,200
impact in relation to the realization of the closure of schools?

65
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,680
So. It is important to close the schools.

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,840
That's very good.

67
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,520
So practically, there are schools that are not closed.

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,760
So, first, in the area of ​​security

69
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,920
homeless.

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,200
In the beginning, you have to say the realization of the wall has lost allowed.

71
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,920
To slow down.

72
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,960
At the beginning, there was no enclosing wall.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,040
It means that the animals were

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,960
practically at school level, in the classroom

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,040
and at the level of the saddle yard, in the middle of the pastures for the animals.

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,960
But once the fences and the fence is installed, we see very

77
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
although really

78
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,000
the animals can no longer have access to the school.

79
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,200
Then, the fact of still teaching in the classes at school is not closed.

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,400
This is yet another risk for the teacher.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Another teacher still in his class, there are the intruders

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,480
of people who will come into your class and give you some .

83
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,200
I don't use it maybe,

84
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,640
but once the fence is there, we close the doors.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Nobody comes in, nobody leaves.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
It is a danger that has been erased.

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,120
In the field of security, we are really

88
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,040
very safe.

89
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,480
And what do you think is the impact

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,400
what does schooling represent?

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,360
for the communities resulting from the schooling of children?

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,160
So, at the beginning, we had a misunderstanding

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,480
from the communities here.

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Today, we clearly see that the schooling of children

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,440
and especially girls, it's something that

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,840
is taken head on by the people.

97
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,320
So, we clearly see that despite their actions at the level of the room

98
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
because the parents of pupils who bring the pupils here to school

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,760
like all parents in any house, there are students who come here

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,600
at school.

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,760
So if your starting point is really schooling

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,120
and reached here at 100%, practically.

103
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,080
This is the question of knowing

104
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
it is well done.

105
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
And I think it's because.
